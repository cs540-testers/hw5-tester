# hw5-tester
This is a tester for HW5 of CS540 at UW Madison.

_**BACK UP YOUR CODE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE.**_

To run, download `test.py` to your working folder.
In a terminal, run
```
python3 test.py
````
or
```
py test.py
```
on some Windows systems.

For this project, the file `mnist.npy` must be present on your system. By default, it is assumed to exist in the same directory from which you run the test script. If this is not the case, you can use the command line argument `--mnist-path` as follows:
```
python3 test.py --mnist-path path/to/mnist.py
```

If you are certain you have correct code, but the tester yields failures, please create an issue at https://github.com/cs540-testers/hw5-tester/issues.
Explain which test case is malfunctioning, and give as much of your code's output as possible (do _**not**_ share any of your code, though).
For a faster response from one of the test developers, ping `@test gang` at https://discord.gg/CuJdjN.

_**DO NOT SHARE ANY CODE.**_
